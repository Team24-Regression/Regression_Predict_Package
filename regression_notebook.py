# # Sendy Logistics Challenge Regression ModelÂ¶
# 

#  # Introduction #

# Sendy is a business-to-business platform established in 2014, to enable businesses of all types and sizes to transport goods more efficiently across East Africa.
# 
# This notebook aims to help Sendy predict the estimated time of delivery of orders, from the point of driver pickup to the point of arrival at final destination. This will enhance customer communication and improve the reliability of its service; which will ultimately improve customer experience. In addition, the solution will enable Sendy to realise cost savings, and ultimately reduce the cost of doing business, through improved resource management and planning for order scheduling
# 
# An accurate arrival time prediction will help all businesses to improve their logistics and communicate an accurate time to their customers.
